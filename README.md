# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Nguyá»…n ThÃ nh Long

ðŸŽ“ Iâ€™m a Business Administration graduate (Vietnamese German University, 2024), but my story doesnâ€™t stop at business. Along the way, I discovered a true passion for software developmentâ€”and I've been building, designing, and coding ever since.

## ðŸš€ My Journey

It all started when I led the **Design and Media team at Presto (2020â€“2022)**. From collaborating with creatives to shaping themes and visual stories, I realized how much I loved solving problems with both design and logic. This passion led me to freelance as a **designer and video editor**, where I worked with clubs, bands, and fashion creatives on 10+ diverse projects.

But I didnâ€™t stop at visuals.

In 2024, I took a deep dive into the technical side of the web:
- At **NewstyleDirect**, I handled **tech support**, fixed bugs, and developed new features that improved user experience and optimized site performance.
- At **WebNow**, I became a **web developer**, completing 15+ projects using WordPress, delivering custom web solutions, and ensuring every site was fast, responsive, and delightful to use.
